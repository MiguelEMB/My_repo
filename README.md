Using git in terminal to create and move files
### Add
## Commit 

I was able to generate my first push from terminal. The first issue was that the terminal was asking form Github credentials. I had to create a token to use as a password in order to succesfully push the files.

In this second test i will push the code, reference and data files to the repositoty
